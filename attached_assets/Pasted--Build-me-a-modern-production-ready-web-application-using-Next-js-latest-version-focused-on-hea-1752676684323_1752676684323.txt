ðŸš€ Build me a modern, production-ready web application using Next.js (latest version) focused on health, fitness, and gym enthusiasts.

The web app should be beautifully designed and include the following:

ðŸŽ¨ Design & UI
Use a futuristic, glassmorphism + neumorphism + gradient style with bright accent colors (e.g., neon green, electric blue, or hot pink) on a dark background.

Smooth animations and transitions (e.g., Framer Motion or similar).

Use modern UI libraries like Tailwind CSS (with custom themes) or shadcn/ui.

Include responsive design: fully mobile-friendly, tablet, and desktop views.

High-quality hero images or background illustrations relevant to gym and health.

Consistent typography and visually stunning sections.

ðŸ›  Features
Home page with an eye-catching hero section, tagline, and call-to-action.

Workout plans listing page & detail pages (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, cardio).

Nutrition & diet tips section.

BMI calculator and/or calorie calculator.

User testimonials carousel or cards.

Blog/articles page about fitness, mental health, supplements, etc.

Contact page with form.

Optional: login/signup for users to save favorite workouts or track progress.

ðŸ“¦ Technical
Use the App Router structure in Next.js.

Organize folders cleanly: /app, /components, /styles, etc.

Add SEO tags (Next SEO or manually).

Deploy-ready: should work on Vercel.

Code must follow clean architecture and be well-commented.

Use TypeScript throughout.

ðŸŒ± Extras (if possible)
Integrate a free, open API (e.g., exercise or nutrition API).

Include charts/graphs (Recharts or similar) to visualize workout progress.

Add smooth scroll and parallax effects.

Add a light/dark mode toggle.

Use icons (Lucide, FontAwesome, etc.).

Footer with social links.

ðŸ“¢ Goal
The website should look stunning, modern, and professional â€” something that could realistically compete with top fitness brands and inspire users to sign up, train, and live healthier.

âœ… Make sure to explain how to run it locally and deploy to Vercel.
âœ… Include a beautiful README.md with screenshots and features.
